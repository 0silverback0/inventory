# Inventory
A basic an imperfect CRUD application in PHP

Any constructive comments or advice is welcomed. 

Also feel free to add to this project to make it better.

One thing i've noticed is that theres not many repos geared for the developer in the very early stages of learning to contribute
actual code to an open source project.

I'd love to this to be just that for any new self taught developer.
